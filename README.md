# CryptoClustering

In this data set we were asked to:

Find the Best Value for k by Using the Original Data 

Code the elbow method algorithm to find the best value for k. Use a range from 1 to 11. (5 points)

To visually identify the optimal value for k, plot a line chart of all the inertia values computed with the different values of k. 



I was also asked to answer the following question:

- Whatâ€™s the best value for k?
- Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means by Using the Original Data 
- Initialize the K-means model with four clusters by using the best value for k. 
- Fit the K-means model by using the original data.

Predict the clusters for grouping the cryptocurrencies by using the original data. Review the resulting array of cluster values. 
- Create a copy of the original data, and then add a new column of the predicted clusters. 
- Using hvPlot, create a scatter plot by setting x="price_change_percentage_24h" and y="price_change_percentage_7d". Color the graph points with the labels that you found by using K-means. Then add the crypto name to the hover_cols parameter to identify the cryptocurrency that each data point represents. 

Optimize the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
- Create a PCA model instance, and set n_components=3.
- Use the PCA model to reduce the features to three principal components. 
- Get the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component.

Create a new DataFrame with the PCA data. Be sure to set the coin_id index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame. Review the resulting DataFrame.

Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means by Using the PCA Data:
- Initialize the K-means model with four clusters by using the best value for k.
- Fit the K-means model by using the PCA data.
- Predict the clusters for grouping the cryptocurrencies by using the PCA data. Review the resulting array of cluster values.
- Create a copy of the DataFrame with the PCA data, and then add a new column to store the predicted clusters.
- Using hvPlot, create a scatter plot by setting x="PC1" and y="PC2". Color the graph points with the labels that you found by using K-means. Then add the crypto name to the hover_cols parameter to identify the cryptocurrency that each data point represents. 

Visualize and Compare the Results
- Create a composite plot by using hvPlot and the plus sign (+) operator to compare the elbow curve that you created from the original data with the one that you created from the PCA data. 
- Create a composite plot by using hvPlot and the plus (+) operator to compare the cryptocurrency clusters that resulted from using the original data with those that resulted from the PCA data. 

Coding Conventions and Formatting
-Place imports at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants. (3 points)
- Name functions and variables with lowercase characters, with words separated by underscores. (2 points)
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, creating maintainable and reusable code. (3 points)
- Use concise logic and creative engineering where possible. (2 points)
